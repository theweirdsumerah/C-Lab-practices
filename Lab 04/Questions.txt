Create a class called “Circle” that calculates and displays the area of a circle. The radius is a private data member of the class, and the compute_area() function is responsible for computing and displaying the area based on the given radius. In the main function, create an object of the Circle class, then display the area of the circle.
Create a class called &quot;summation&quot; with the PRIVATE variables number1 and number2. Use a constructor to initialize these private variables. calculate the sum of these numbers.
Create a class called &quot;Rectangle&quot; with the PRIVATE variables length, width. Implement the constructor to initialize the length and width when an object is created. Implement the "getArea()" method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
